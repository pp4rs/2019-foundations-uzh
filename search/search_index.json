Welcome Message Date Posted: 2019-01-21 Welcome to the course \"Programming Practices for Research in Economics: Foundations.\"\" Please take a look around the course website before the course begins. All the latest information about the course contents, schedule and course locations (which vary day-by day!) are available on these pages. We particularly draw your attention to the: Installation Guide . These pages walk you through the steps needed to install all the software for the course. We expect you to have completed it before the course begins. Note that we expect you have tried to complete the guide yourself, and we will not be there to do it all for you. The guide is modular in nature - with most steps being independent of those before and after. Learning to install software for scientific research on your own machine is an important task in itself - and we want to help you become self-sufficient in this regard. Pre-Course Survey . Please fill this out before the course begins. To avoid clogging up everyone's inboxes with course email, all future important information will be posted on the course's Announcements page - be sure to check in there regularly.
