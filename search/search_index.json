You can find it here Software Installation Guide You will need to install the necessary software on to your laptop to bring to the class each day so you can code along with us. The most recent version of the installation guide is here . Tip Please try and install all the software before the course begins. If you are struggling we are able to help - but we expect you have tried to work through the guide yourself. Drop an email to pp4rs.contact@gmail.com if you need assistance and we will set up a time to meet. Slack Chat Throughout the course we will post useful tidbits of information, and answer questions that are slightly off topic in a web-chat environment called Slack.

If you have questions - direct them to us via Slack . There's a 'Direct Message' feature so you can contact us individually as needed, but where possible post messages to a channel that all participants can see. Example Final Assignment Date Posted: 2019-01-24 Lachlan has constructed an example final assignment. It uses only R packages that were taught in the course, or available in the additional material and a simplified Snakemake set up (particularly for the pdf generation). You can check it out here Final Assignment Date Posted: 2019-02-21 Detail about the course assignment: Due date: Saturday, March 16 at 23:59. Discuss with one of us your proposed assignment before you start We can evaluate whether it is do-able within the time frame Don't try and be too fancy, it's more important that it works The assignment must: Produce at least one figure and one table of results that are saved to file Do some form of data cleaning / manipulation as part of the workflow The initial \"dataset\" cannot be the one that generates the regression / figures Use Snakemake to execute the workflow Submission format: Invite @lachlandeer to collaborate on your GitHub repository by the due date. He will potentially allocate another instructor to assess your work. This means, we expect well version controlled work. Tag your final submission using the following git command git tag -a v1.0 -m \"submitted version\" You must have a README.md in the main directory with instructions on how we can build the assignment & what it does. Explictly document somewhere what packages we need to install so that your assignment runs on our machine with no issues. Even better : use the scripts we provided in the Snakemake example to install needed packages for us Your assignment must execute by us typing: snakemake (preferred) snakemake all into a terminal that is opened into your project's directory To pass the course: Your code must build without errors (unless we find something really weird, then we will reach out to you) Must be version controlled, with each contributor making commits. One final commit is not enough. Inputs and outputs must be in separate folders Welcome Message Date Posted: 2019-01-21 Welcome to the course \"Programming Practices for Research in Economics: Foundations.\"\" Please take a look around the course website before the course begins. All the latest information about the course contents, schedule and course locations (which vary day-by day!) are available on these pages. We particularly draw your attention to the: Installation Guide . These pages walk you through the steps needed to install all the software for the course. We expect you to have completed it before the course begins. Note that we expect you have tried to complete the guide yourself, and we will not be there to do it all for you. The guide is modular in nature - with most steps being independent of those before and after. Learning to install software for scientific research on your own machine is an important task in itself - and we want to help you become self-sufficient in this regard. Pre-Course Survey . Please fill this out before the course begins. To avoid clogging up everyone's inboxes with course email, all future important information will be posted on the course's Announcements page - be sure to check in there regularly.
